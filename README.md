My first from the scratch website design. In terms of functionality, a classic portfolio site. I tried to apply SEO to this website, to make sure it gets the best scores from the lighthouse. I applied a little bit of glassmorphism to the design. Of course, it is responsive and it ensures the user can see the optimal layout for its screen.
